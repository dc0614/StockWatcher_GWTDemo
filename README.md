# StockWatcher_GWTDemo

This is just a copy of the GWT Sample StockWatcher program. I am going to convert the program just as an active learning session. There is still plenty of functionality to add and/or remove from this program. There is also a lot of HTML and CSS changes that can be made in this program. This is a good start for anyone learning how to program or anyone that wants to focus on learning GWT. So lets have some fun!
